## Analytics and Reporting

The solution includes analytics capabilities to track:

1. Document processing volume by type and service line
2. Average processing time
3. Extraction confidence scores
4. Error rates and common error types
5. Cost savings and efficiency metrics

## Training and Customization

The framework includes a feedback loop for continuous improvement:

1. Document templates are stored in the Templates library
2. Manual corrections are logged for model improvement
3. Service-line specific terminology and document types can be added
4. Custom extraction rules can be defined for unique document types

## Security and Compliance

- All documents are processed within the Microsoft ecosystem
- Data classification is applied based on document content
- Audit logs track all access and modifications
- Retention policies align with organizational requirements`,
